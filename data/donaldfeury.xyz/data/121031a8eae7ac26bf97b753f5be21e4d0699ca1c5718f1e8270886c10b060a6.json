There were about 3-4 widely used packages to manage dependencies, which sometimes made it weird to work on another codebase that used a different dependency management tool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, in 1.11, go included its own dependency management tool called go modules. Go modules are now the standard way of handling your go project\u0026#39;s dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this video, I go a brief rundown of how to add dependencies to your project, get a better understand of why certain packages are being included, and how to trim old dependencies out of your project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCheck it out and let me know what y\u0026#39;all think.
