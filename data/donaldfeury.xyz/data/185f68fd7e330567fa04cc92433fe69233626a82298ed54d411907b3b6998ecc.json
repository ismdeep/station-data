Normally, this is something you see in separate 3rd party libraries or included in full frameworks, such as Laravel or Rails.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s very powerful too. In addition to injecting your data into templates, you can extend what you can do while processing the data passed into a template by passing in a map of functions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI once used it to generate the approx. 150 data types that were listed in Mixer\u0026#39;s API documentation. That saved me tons of time from writing boilerplate code.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCheck it out and let me know what y\u0026#39;all think.
