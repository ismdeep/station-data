For seven years, the Go Team has conducted a regular survey of Go\ndevelopers. The results of this survey have helped the team plan and prioritize\nlarge changes to the Go ecosystem, such as dependency management, vulnerability\nscanning, and generics. We want Go to be increasingly usable by and useful to\ndevelopers, and your feedback has been a critical aspect of making that happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo here is \u003ca href=\"https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bNnbAtFZ0vfRTH8?s=b\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe January 2023 edition of the Go Developer\nSurvey\u003c/a\u003e!
