This approach allows us to ask about\na wider variety of topics than in prior years while also reducing the survey’s length.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday we are launching the 2020 Go Developer Survey.\nWe’d love to hear from everyone who uses Go,\nused to use Go, or is interested in using Go,\nto help ensure the language, community, and ecosystem fit the needs of the\npeople closest to it.\nPlease help us shape Go’s future by participating in this 10-minute survey by November 8th:\n\u003ca href=\"https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1O0A5f70Q38dlVr\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTake the 2020 Go Developer Survey\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"spread-the-word\"\u003eSpread the word!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need as many Gophers as possible to participate in this survey to help\nus better understand our global user base.\nWe’d be grateful if you would spread the word by sharing this post on your\nsocial network feeds,\naround the office, at virtual meet-ups, and in other communities.
