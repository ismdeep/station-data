2009,\nwhen we were getting ready to share Go with the world.\nWe didn’t know what kind of reaction to expect,\nwhether anyone would care about this little language.\nI hoped that even if no one ended up using Go,\nwe would at least have drawn attention to some good ideas,\nespecially Go’s approach to concurrency and interfaces,\nthat could influence follow-on languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce it became clear that people were excited about Go,\nI looked at the history of popular languages\nlike C, C++, Perl, Python, and Ruby,\nexamining how long each took to gain widespread adoption.\nFor example, Perl seemed to me to have appeared fully-formed\nin the mid-to-late 1990s, with CGI scripts and the web,\nbut it was first released in 1987.\nThis pattern repeated for almost every language I looked at:\nit seems to take roughly a decade of quiet, steady improvement\nand dissemination before a new language really takes off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered: where would Go be after a decade?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, we can answer that question:\nGo is everywhere, used by at least \u003ca href=\"https://research.swtch.com/gophercount\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea million developers worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo’s original target was networked system infrastructure,\nwhat we now call cloud software.\nEvery major cloud provider today uses core cloud infrastructure written in Go,\nsuch as Docker, Etcd, Istio, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Terraform;\nthe majority of the\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.cncf.io/projects/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCloud Native Computing Foundation’s projects\u003c/a\u003e\nare written in Go.\nCountless companies are using Go to move their own work to the cloud as well,\nfrom startups building from scratch\nto enterprises modernizing their software stack.\nGo has also found adoption well beyond its original cloud target,\nwith uses ranging\nfrom\ncontrolling tiny embedded systems with\n\u003ca href=\"https://gobot.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoBot\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://tinygo.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTinyGo\u003c/a\u003e\nto detecting cancer with\n\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/grail-eng/bigslice-a-cluster-computing-system-for-go-7e03acd2419b\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emassive big data analysis and machine learning at GRAIL\u003c/a\u003e,\nand everything in between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this is to say that Go has succeeded beyond our wildest dreams.\nAnd Go’s success isn’t just about the language.\nIt’s about the language, the ecosystem, and especially the community working together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2009, the language was a good idea with a working sketch of an implementation.\nThe \u003ccode\u003ego\u003c/code\u003e command did not exist:\nwe ran commands like \u003ccode\u003e6g\u003c/code\u003e to compile and \u003ccode\u003e6l\u003c/code\u003e to link binaries,\nautomated with makefiles.\nWe typed semicolons at the ends of statements.\nThe entire program stopped during garbage collection,\nwhich then struggled to make good use of two cores.\nGo ran only on Linux and Mac, on 32- and 64-bit x86 and 32-bit ARM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the last decade, with the help of Go developers all over the world,\nwe have evolved this idea and sketch into a productive language\nwith fantastic tooling,\na production-quality implementation,\na\n\u003ca href=\"/blog/ismmkeynote\"\u003estate-of-the-art garbage collector\u003c/a\u003e,\nand \u003ca href=\"/doc/install/source#introduction\"\u003eports to 12 operating systems and 10 architectures\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny programming language needs the support of a thriving ecosystem.\nThe open source release was the seed for that ecosystem,\nbut since then, many people have contributed their time and talent\nto fill the Go ecosystem with great tutorials, books, courses, blog posts,\npodcasts, tools, integrations, and of course reusable Go packages importable with \u003ccode\u003ego\u003c/code\u003e \u003ccode\u003eget\u003c/code\u003e.\nGo could never have succeeded without the support of this ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the ecosystem needs the support of a thriving community.\nIn 2019 there are dozens of Go conferences all over the world,\nalong with\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/go\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eover 150 Go meetup groups with over 90,000 members\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003ca

rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWomen Who Go\u003c/a\u003e\nhelp bring new voices into the Go community,\nthrough mentoring, training, and conference scholarships.\nThis year alone, they have taught\nhundreds of people from traditionally underrepresented groups\nat workshops where community members teach and mentor those new to Go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are\n\u003ca href=\"https://research.swtch.com/gophercount\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eover a million Go developers\u003c/a\u003e\nworldwide,\nand companies all over the globe are looking to hire more.\nIn fact, people often tell us that learning Go\nhelped them get their first jobs in the tech industry.\nIn the end, what we’re most proud of about Go\nis not a well-designed feature or a clever bit of code\nbut the positive impact Go has had in so many people’s lives.\nWe aimed to create a language that would help us be better developers,\nand we are thrilled that Go has helped so many others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs\n\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GoTurns10\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e#GoTurns10\u003c/a\u003e,\nI hope everyone will take a moment to celebrate\nthe Go community and all we have achieved.\nOn behalf of the entire Go team at Google,\nthank you to everyone who has joined us over the past decade.\nLet’s make the next one even more incredible!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ccenter\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"10years/gopher10th-pin-large.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg
