Results show that 43% use it because it allows them to use the same debugging strategy across different languages, and 42% prefer to use text logging over other debugging techniques.\nHowever, 27% don’t know how to get started with Go’s debugging tools and 24% have never tried using Go’s debugging tools, so there’s an opportunity to improve the debugger tooling in terms of discoverability, usability and documentation.\nAdditionally, because a quarter of respondents have never tried using debugging tools, pain points may be underreported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/why_printf.svg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"sentiments\"\u003eSentiments towards Go\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, this year we asked about overall satisfaction. 92% of respondents said they were very or somewhat satisfied using Go during the past year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/csat.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of overall satisfaction on a 5 points scale from very dissatisfied to very satisfied\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the 3rd year we’ve asked the “Would you recommend…” \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNet Promoter Score\u003c/a\u003e (NPS) question.

This year we saw an increase in respondents who agreed that Go is critical to their company’s success from 59% in 2019 to 66% in 2020.

Satisfaction with using cloud services, debugging, and using modules (areas that last year were highlighted as opportunities for improvement) increased while most importance scores remained about the same. We also introduced a couple new topics: API and Web frameworks. We see that web frameworks satisfaction is lower than other areas (64%). It wasn’t as critically important to most current users (only 28% of respondents said it was very or critically important), but it could be a missing critical feature for would-be Go developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/feature_sat_yoy.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of satisfaction with aspects of Go from 2019 to 2020, showing highest satisfaction with build speed, reliability and using concurrency and lowest with web frameworks\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TOC_6.2\"\u003e81% of respondents said they felt very or extremely productive using Go.

We don’t see any significant changes from last year, when we introduced randomization into the ordering of options. (Prior to 2019, options towards the beginning of the list were disproportionately selected.)\nWe also broke this out by organization size and found that respondents use Go similarly at large enterprises or smaller organizations, although large orgs are a little less likely to use Go for web services returning HTML.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/app_yoy.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of Go use cases from 2019 to 2020 including API or RPC services, CLIs, frameworks, web services, automation, agents and daemons, data processing, GUIs, games and mobile apps\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year we now have a better understanding of which kinds of software respondents write in Go at home versus at work. Although web services returning HTML is the 4th most common use case, this is due to non-work related use. More respondents use Go for automation/scripts, agents and daemons, and data processing for work than web services returning HTML.\nA greater proportion of the least common uses (desktop/GUI apps, games, and mobile apps) are being written outside of work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/app_context.svg\" alt=\"Stacked bar charts of proportion of use case is at work, outside of work, or both \" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother new question asked how satisfied respondents were for each use case.\nCLIs had the highest satisfaction, with 85% of respondents saying they were very, moderately or slightly satisfied using Go for CLIs.\nCommon uses for Go tended to have higher satisfaction scores, but satisfaction and popularity don’t perfectly correspond.\nFor example, agents and daemons has 2nd highest proportion of satisfaction but it’s 6th in usage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/app_sat_bin.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of satisfaction with each use case\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditional follow-up questions explored different use cases, for example, which platforms respondents target with their CLIs.\nIt’s not surprising to see Linux (93%) and macOS (59%) highly represented, given the high developer use of Linux and macOS and high Linux cloud usage), but even Windows is targeted by almost a third of CLI developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/cli_platforms.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of platforms being targeted for CLIs\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA closer look at Go for data

src=\"survey2020/dpe.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of data processing engines used by those who use Go for data processing\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also asked about larger areas in which respondents work with Go.\nThe most common area by far was web development (68%),\nbut other common areas included databases (46%), DevOps (42%)\nnetwork programming (41%) and systems programming (40%).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/domain_yoy.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of the kind of work where Go is being used\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TOC_7.1\"\u003eSimilar to last year, we found that 76% of respondents evaluate the current Go release for production use, but this year we refined our time scale and found that 60% begin evaluating a new version before or within 2 months of release.\nThis highlights the importance for platform-as-a-service providers to quickly support new stable releases of Go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/update_time.svg\" alt=\"Bar

Go modules, and a significant increase in the proportion of respondents who only use modules for package management. 96% of respondents said they were using modules for package management, up from 89% last year. 87% of respondents said they were using \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e modules for package management, up from 71% last year.\nMeanwhile, the use of other package management tools has

The package discovery site pkg.go.dev is new to the list this year and was a top resource for 32% of respondents. Respondents who use pkg.go.dev are more likely to agree they are able to quickly find Go packages / libraries they need: 91% for pkg.go.dev users vs. 82% for everyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/resources.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of top 5 resources respondents use to answer Go-related questions\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years, the proportion of respondents\nwho do not attend any Go-related events has been trending up. Due to Covid-19, this year we modified our question around Go events, and found over a quarter of respondents have spent more time in online Go channels than in prior years, and 14% attended a virtual Go meetup, twice as many as last year. 64% of those who attended a virtual event said this was their first virtual event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/events.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of respondents participation in online channels and events\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TOC_12.1\"\u003eWe found 12% of respondents identify with a traditionally underrepresented group (e.g.,\nethnicity, gender identity, et al.), the same as 2019, and 2% identify as women, fewer than in 2019 (3%).\nRespondents who identified with underrepresented groups showed higher rates of disagreement with the statement\n\u0026#34;I feel welcome in the Go community\u0026#34; (10% vs. 4%) than those who do not identify with an underrepresented group. These questions allow us to measure diversity in the community and highlight opportunities for outreach and growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/underrep.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of underrepresented groups\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/underrep_groups_women.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of those who identify as women\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/welcome_underrep.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of welcomeness of underrepresented groups\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe added an additional question this year on assistive technology usage, and found that 8% of respondents are using some form of assistive technology. The most commonly used assistive tech was contrast or color settings (2%). This is a great reminder that we have users with accessibility needs and helps drive some of our design decisions on websites managed by the Go team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2020/at.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of assistive technology usage\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Go team values diversity and inclusion, not simply as the right thing to do, but because diverse voices can illuminate our blindspots and ultimately benefit all users. The way we ask about sensitive information, including gender and traditionally underrepresented groups, has changed according to data privacy regulations and we hope to make these questions, particularly around gender diversity, more inclusive in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you for joining us in reviewing the results of our 2020 developer survey!\nUnderstanding developers’ experiences and challenges helps us measure our progress and directs the future of Go.\nThanks again to everyone who contributed to this survey—we couldn’t have done it without you.
