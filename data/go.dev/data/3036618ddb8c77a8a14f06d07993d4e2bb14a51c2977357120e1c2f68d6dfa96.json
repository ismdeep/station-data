The specific questions each person will see are randomly selected, so you won’t see every question we ask. This approach allows us to ask about a wide variety of topics while also reducing the survey’s length.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"spread-the-word\"\u003eSpread the word!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need as many Gophers as possible to participate in this survey to help\nus better understand our global user base.\nWe’d be grateful if you would spread the word by sharing this post on your\nsocial network feeds,\naround the office, at virtual meet-ups, and in other communities.
