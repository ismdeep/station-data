2020\n      \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003cp\u003eGo always comes second to more\nbasic concerns like personal and family health and safety.\nAround the world, the past couple months have been terrible,\nand we are still at the start of this awful pandemic.\nThere are days when it seems like working on\nanything related to Go should be considered a serious priority inversion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after we’ve done all we can\nto prepare ourselves and our families for whatever is coming,\ngetting back to some approximation of a familiar routine\nand normal work is a helpful coping mechanism.\nIn that spirit, we intend to keep working on Go\nand trying to help the Go community as much as we can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this post we want to share a few important notes about\nhow the pandemic is affecting the Go community,\na few things we’re doing to help, what you can do to help,\nand our plans for Go itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conferences-and-meetups\"\u003eConferences and Meetups\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Go community thrives on in-person conferences and meetups.\nWe had anticipated 35 conferences this year\nand thousands of meetups, nearly all of which have\nnow changed, been postponed, or been canceled.\nWe’ll keep the\n\u003ca href=\"/wiki/Conferences\"\u003econferences wiki page\u003c/a\u003e\nupdated as plans change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe want to do everything we can to help support impacted Go conferences.\nWe also want to support efforts to explore\nnew ways for gophers to connect in the time of social distancing.\nIn addition to honoring Google’s existing sponsorships,\nwe are interested to offer support to people planning\nvirtual conference alternatives through the rest of the year.\nIf you are organizing a Go conference and have been impacted,\nor if you are considering holding a virtual alternative,\nplease reach out to Carmen Andoh at

href=\"/learn/\"\u003ein-person training\u003c/a\u003e\nfor companies that want help adopting Go.\nThat in-person teaching is crucial to bringing\nnew gophers into the community;\nwe’re incredibly grateful to the trainers for the work they do.\nUnfortunately, on-site training contracts have all been canceled\nfor the next few months, and the trainers in our community\nhave lost their primary (or sole) source of income.\nWe encourage companies to consider virtual training\nand workshops during this difficult time.\nMost trainers are being flexible with pricing,\nscheduling, and class structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"job-postings\"\u003eJob Postings\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe know that the current downturn means that some\ngophers are looking for new jobs.\nThe Go

we think are the most important projects for 2020.\nLike all of you, we’re at reduced capacity, so the work\ncontinues slower than planned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur analysis of the Go 2019 user survey is almost complete,\nand we hope to post it soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least for now, we intend to keep to our timeline for Go 1.15,\nwith the understanding that it will probably have fewer new features\nand improvements than we originally planned.\nWe continue to do code reviews, issue triage,\nand \u003ca href=\"/s/proposal-minutes\"\u003eproposal
