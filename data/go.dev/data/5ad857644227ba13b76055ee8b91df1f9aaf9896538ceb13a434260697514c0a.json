This blog post provides an overview of\nwhat you can expect to see on the site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"grouping-related-package-search-results\"\u003eGrouping related package search results\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSearch results for packages in the same module are now grouped together. The\nmost relevant package for the search request is highlighted. This change was\nmade to reduce noise when several packages in the same module may be relevant\nto a search. For example, searching for “markdown” shows a row listing “Other\npackages in module” for several of the results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"pkgsite-search-redesign/markdown.png\" width=\"850\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResults for different major versions of the same module are also now grouped\ntogether. The highest major version containing a tagged release is highlighted.\nFor example, searching for “github” shows the v39 module, with older versions\nlisted as “Other major versions”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"pkgsite-search-redesign/github.png\" width=\"850\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, we have reorganized information related to imports, versions, and\nlicenses. We also added links to these tabs directly from the search results\npage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"introducing-symbol-search\"\u003eIntroducing symbol search\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past year, we have introduced more information about symbols on\npkg.go.dev and worked on improving the way that information is presented. We\nlaunched the ability to view the API history of any package. We also label\nsymbols that are deprecated in the documentation index and hide them by\ndefault in the package documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this search update, pkg.go.dev now also supports searching for symbols in\nGo packages. When a user types a symbol into the search bar, they will be\nbrought to a new search tab for symbol search results. There are a few\ndifferent ways in which pkg.go.dev identifies that users are searching for a\nsymbol. We’ve added examples to the pkg.go.dev homepage, and detailed\ninstructions to the \u003ca href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/search-help\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esearch help page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"pkgsite-search-redesign/httpclient.png\" width=\"850\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"feedback\"\u003eFeedback\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re excited to share this new search experience with you, and we would love\nto hear your feedback!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, please use the “Report an Issue” button at the bottom of every page\non the site to share your input.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re interested in contributing to this project, pkg.go.dev is open\nsource!
