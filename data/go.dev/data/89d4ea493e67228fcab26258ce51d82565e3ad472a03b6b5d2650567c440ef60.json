We, the Go team,\nhope to use this blog to keep the world up-to-date on the development of\nthe Go programming language and the growing ecosystem of libraries and applications surrounding it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been a few months since we launched (November last year),\nso let’s talk about what’s been happening in Go World since then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core team at Google has continued to develop the language,\ncompilers, packages, tools, and documentation.\nThe compilers now produce code that is in some cases between 2x and an order\nof magnitude faster than at release.\nWe have put together some graphs of a selection of \u003ca href=\"http://godashboard.appspot.com/benchmarks\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBenchmarks\u003c/a\u003e,\nand the \u003ca href=\"http://godashboard.appspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBuild Status\u003c/a\u003e page tracks the\nreliability of each changeset submitted to the repository.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have made syntax changes to make the language more concise,\nregular, and flexible.\nSemicolons have been \u003ca href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/t/5ee32b588d10f2e9\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ealmost entirely removed\u003c/a\u003e from the language.\nThe \u003ca href=\"/doc/go_spec.html#Function_types\"\u003e…T syntax\u003c/a\u003e\nmakes it simpler to handle an arbitrary number of typed function parameters.\nThe syntax x[lo:] is now shorthand for x[lo:len(x)].\nGo also now natively supports complex numbers.\nSee the \u003ca href=\"/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003erelease notes\u003c/a\u003e for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cmd/godoc/\"\u003eGodoc\u003c/a\u003e now provides better support for\nthird-party libraries,\nand a new tool - \u003ca href=\"/cmd/goinstall\"\u003egoinstall\u003c/a\u003e - has been\nreleased to make it easy to install them.\nAdditionally, we’ve started working on a package tracking system to make\nit easier to find what you need.\nYou can view the beginnings of this on the \u003ca href=\"http://godashboard.appspot.com/package\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePackages page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than 40,000 lines of code have been added to \u003ca href=\"/pkg/\"\u003ethe standard library\u003c/a\u003e,\nincluding many entirely new packages, a sizable portion written by external contributors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of third parties, since launch a vibrant community has flourished\non our \u003ca href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emailing list\u003c/a\u003e and\nirc channel (#go-nuts on freenode).\nWe have officially added more than 50 people to the project.\nTheir contributions range from bug fixes and documentation corrections to\ncore packages and support for additional operating systems (Go is now supported under FreeBSD,\nand a \u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/go/wiki/WindowsPort\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWindows port\u003c/a\u003e is underway).\nWe regard these community contributions our greatest success so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve received some good reviews, too.  This \u003ca href=\"http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/337773/google_go_captures_developers_imaginations/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erecent article in PC World\u003c/a\u003e\nsummarized the enthusiasm surrounding the project.\nSeveral bloggers have begun documenting their experiences in the language\n(see \u003ca href=\"http://golang.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e,\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.infi.nl/blog/view/id/47\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e,\nand \u003ca href=\"http://freecella.blogspot.com/2010/01/gospecify-basic-setup-of-projects.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\nfor example)  The general reaction of our users has been very positive;\none first-timer remarked \u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/5fabdd59f8562ed2\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e“I came away extremely impressed. Go walks an elegant line between simplicity and power.”\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs to the future: we have listened to the myriad voices telling us what they need,\nand are now focused on getting Go ready for the prime time.\nWe are improving the garbage collector, runtime scheduler,\ntools, and standard libraries, as well as exploring new language features.\n2010 will be an exciting year for Go, and we look forward to collaborating\nwith the community to make it a successful one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003c/div\u003e",
