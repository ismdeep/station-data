Now that we have reached\nthat milestone, I cannot help but reflect on how much the project and\necosystem has grown since then. In our post 4 years ago we included a chart\ndemonstrating Go’s rising popularity on Google Trends with the search term\n“golang”. Today, we’re including an updated chart. In this relative scale of\npopularity, what was 100 four years ago is now a mere 17.
