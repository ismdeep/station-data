Over\nthe past seven years, the Go team has conducted regular surveys of Go\ndevelopers and used the results to prioritize language, runtime, and tooling\nimprovements. We want Go to be increasingly usable by and useful to\ndevelopers, and your feedback has been a critical part of making this happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis survey will help the Go team understand your overall experience working\nwith Go, the tech stacks developers commonly use alongside Go, interest in\nAI/ML developer tooling, challenges when building microservices, and more. The\nsurvey will run through August 10th and we plan to publish anonymous,\naggregated results in September. It should take about 10 minutes to complete\nand all questions are optional. Please help shape Go’s future by sharing your\nthoughts and experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4Vi4bNaMQhQdqSi?s=b\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTake the Go Developer\nSurvey\u003c/a\u003e (open\nJuly 25th – August 10th)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003c/div\u003e",
