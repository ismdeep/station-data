Today, our users come from a wide\nvariety of backgrounds, experiences, and expectations. The needs\nof users are growing faster than the Go project can currently address\nthem. To streamline the experience for first-time Go users,\nwe’ve created the Developer eXperience Working Group (DXWG).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next three months, this group will work together on delivering:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eimprovements to the Go installation experience\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ebetter guidelines to help new users\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eguides on tooling and developer environments (editors and IDEs)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003erunning user studies to systematically analyze and measure friction points\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eimprovements to the \u003ca href=\"/tour/\"\u003eGo Tour\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"/play/\"\u003eGo Playground\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA secondary goal of the working group is to better understand how to\ninvolve the Go community in charting Go’s future. We hope that working\ngroups – Go team members working alongside community members – will\nhelp Go scale its leadership and address user needs.  We’ll learn\nfrom this experience and iterate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe initial members of the working group are:\nCarmen Andoh, Chris Broadfoot, Francesc Campoy, Jaana Burcu Dogan,\nSteve Francia, Jess Frazelle, Bill Kennedy, Katrina Owen, Natalie\nPistunovich, Mat Ryer, Dmitri Shuralyov.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are looking for additional people to help with contributing\ncode, writing documentation, sharing feedback and experiences\n(user stories), reviewing contributions, and more.
