There were a few reported\nincidents where actions took place outside of project spaces\nbut the impact was felt inside our community. The specific\nlanguage in our code of conduct restricted our ability to\nrespond only to actions happening “in the official\nforums operated by the Go project”. We needed a way\nto protect our community members wherever they are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second lesson we learned is that the demands required\nto enforce the code\nof conduct place too heavy of a burden on volunteers.\nThe initial version of the code of conduct presented the\nworking group as disciplinarians. It was soon clear\nthat this was too much, so in early 2017 \u003ca href=\"/cl/37014\"\u003ewe changed the group’s role\u003c/a\u003e\nto that of advisors and mediators.\nStill, working group community members\nreported feeling overwhelmed, untrained, and vulnerable.\nThis well-intentioned shift left us without an enforcement mechanism\nwithout solving the issue with overburdened volunteers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn mid-2017, I represented the Go project in a meeting with\nGoogle’s Open Source Programs Office and Open Source Strategy Team\nto address the shortcomings in our respective\ncodes of conduct, particularly in their enforcement.\nIt quickly became clear that our problems had a lot in common,\nand that working together on a single code of conduct for all\nof Google’s open source projects made sense.\nWe started with the text from the\nContributor Covenant Code of Conduct v1.4\nand then made changes, influenced by\nour experiences in Go community and our collective experiences in open source.\nThis resulted in the Google \u003ca href=\"https://opensource.google.com/docs/releasing/template/CODE_OF_CONDUCT/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecode of conduct template\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday the Go project is adopting this new code of conduct,\nand we’ve updated \u003ca href=\"/conduct\"\u003egolang.org/conduct\u003c/a\u003e.\nThis revised code of conduct retains much of the intent, structure and\nlanguage of the original Go code of conduct while making two critical\nchanges that address the shortcomings identified above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, \u003ca href=\"/conduct/#scope\"\u003ethe new code of conduct makes clear\u003c/a\u003e that people who\nparticipate in any kind of harassment or inappropriate behavior,\neven outside our project spaces, are not welcome in our project spaces.\nThis means that the Code of Conduct applies outside\nthe project spaces when there is a reasonable belief that\nan individual’s behavior may have a negative\nimpact on the project or its community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, in the place of the working group,\n\u003ca href=\"/conduct/#reporting\"\u003ethe new code of conduct introduces a single Project Steward\u003c/a\u003e\nwho will have explicit training and support for this role.\nThe Project Steward will receive reported violations\nand then work with a committee,\nconsisting of representatives from the Open Source Programs Office\nand the Google Open Source Strategy team,\nto find a resolution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur first Project Steward will be \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/cassandraoid\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCassandra Salisbury\u003c/a\u003e.\nShe is well known to the Go community as a member of Go Bridge,\nan organizer of many Go meetups and conferences,\nand as a lead of the Go community outreach working group.\nCassandra now works on the Go team at Google\nwith a focus on advocating for and supporting the Go community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are grateful to everyone who served on the original Code of\nConduct Working Group. Your efforts were essential in creating an\ninclusive and safe community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe believe the code of conduct has contributed to the\nGo project becoming more welcoming now than it was in 2015,\nand we should all be proud of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hope that the new code of conduct will help protect our community\nmembers even more effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003c/div\u003e",
