Thank you for putting in the time to provide the community with these insights on your experiences using Go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"highlights\"\u003eHighlights\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMost responses were consistent with prior years. For example, \u003ca href=\"#satisfaction\"\u003esatisfaction with Go is still very high at 92%\u003c/a\u003e and 75% of respondents use Go at work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis year we \u003ca href=\"#changes\"\u003erandomly sampled\u003c/a\u003e some participants using the Go VS Code plugin, which resulted in some shifts in who responded to the survey.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMissing critical libraries, language features and infrastructure were the most \u003ca href=\"#adoption\"\u003ecommon barriers to using Go\u003c/a\u003e.

Consistent with previous years, Go is primarily used in the tech industry. 70% of respondents were software developers, with a few in IT or DevOps and 76% of respondents said they program in Go at work.\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/industry_yoy.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of industries where respondents work\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/where_yoy.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart showing Go used more at work than outide of work\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/app_yoy.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of uses for Go where API/RPC services and CLI apps are most common\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome new demographics from 2021:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMost respondents describe their organization as an enterprise or small to medium business, with about a quarter describing their organization as a startup. Consultancies and public institutions were much less common.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe vast majority of respondents work on teams of less than ten people.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOver half (55%) of respondents use Go at work on a daily basis. Respondents use Go less frequently outside of work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/orgtype.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of organization type where enterprise is the most common response\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/teamsize.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of team size where 2 to 5 is the most common size\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/gofreq_comparison.svg\" alt=\"Frequency of using Go at work versus outside of work where using Go at work is most often on a daily basis and outside of work is less common and most often on a weekly basis\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"gender\"\u003eGender identity\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ask about gender identity on the survey because it gives us an idea of who is being represented in the results and adds another dimension to measure the inclusivity of the community. The Go team values diversity and inclusion, not only because it’s the right thing to do, but because diverse voices help us make better decisions. This year we rephrased the gender identity question to be more inclusive of other gender identities. About the same proportion identified as women as previous years (2%). This was true in the \u003ca href=\"#changes\"\u003erandomly sampled group\u003c/a\u003e as well, suggesting this is not just due to sampling.\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/gender.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart showing gender identity of respondents where 92% of respondents identify as male\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"assistive-technology\"\u003eAssistive technology\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year we again found that about 8% of respondents are using some form of assistive technology.  Most challenges concerned a need for higher contrast themes and increased font sizes on Go-related websites or in their code editors; we’re planning to act on the website feedback later this year. These accessibility needs are something we should all keep in mind when contributing to the Go ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"adoption\"\u003eA closer look at challenges to Go adoption\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year we revised our questions to target actual cases where Go wasn’t adopted and why. First, we asked whether or not respondents had evaluated using another language against Go in the last year. 43% of respondents said they had either evaluated switching to Go, from Go, or adopting Go when there wasn’t a previously established language. 80% of these evaluations were primarily for business reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/evaluated.svg\" alt=\"Chart showing proportion of respondents who evaluated Go against another language in the last year\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe expected the most common use cases for Go would be the most common intended uses for those evaluating Go. API/RPC services was by far the most common use, but surprisingly, data processing was the second most common intended use case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/intended_app.svg\" alt=\"Chart showing the kind application they considered using Go\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf those respondents who evaluated Go, 75% ended up using Go. (Of course, since nearly all survey respondents report using Go, we likely are not hearing from developers who evaluated Go and decided against using it.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/adopted.svg\" alt=\"Chart showing proportion who used Go compared to those who stayed with the current language or chose another language\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo those who evaluated Go and didn’t use it, we then asked what challenges prevented them from using Go and which of those was the primary barrier.\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/blockers.svg\" alt=\"Chart showing barriers to using Go\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture we get from these results supports previous findings that missing features and lack of ecosystem / library support are the most significant technical barriers to Go adoption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe asked for more details on what features or libraries respondents were missing and found that generics was the most common critical missing feature—we expect this to be a less significant barrier after the introduction of generics in Go 1.18. The next most common missing features had to do with Go’s type system. We would like to see how introducing generics may influence or resolve underlying needs around Go’s type system before making additional changes. For now, we will gather more information on the contexts for these needs and may in the future explore different ways to meet those needs such as through tooling, libraries or changes to the type system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for missing libraries, there was no clear consensus on what addition would unblock the largest proportion of those wanting to adopt Go. That will require additional exploration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what did respondents use instead when they didn’t choose Go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/lang_instead.svg\" alt=\"Chart of which languages respondents used instead of Go\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust, Python, and Java are the most common choices. \u003ca href=\"https://thenewstack.io/rust-vs-go-why-theyre-better-together/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRust and Go have complementary feature sets\u003c/a\u003e, so Rust may be a good option for when Go doesn’t meet feature needs for a project. The primary reasons for using Python were missing libraries and existing infrastructure support, so Python’s large package ecosystem may make it difficult to switch to Go. Similarly, the most common reason for using Java instead was because of Go’s missing features, which may be alleviated by the introduction of generics in the 1.18 release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"satisfaction\"\u003eGo satisfaction and prioritization\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s look at areas where Go is doing well and where things can be improved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsistent with last year, 92% of respondents said they were very or somewhat satisfied using Go during the past year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/csat.svg\" alt=\"Overall satisfaction on a 5 points scale from very dissatisfied to very satisfied\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYear over year trends in community attitudes have seen minor fluctuations. Those using Go for less than 3 months tend to be less likely to agree with these statements. Respondents are increasingly finding Go critical for their company’s success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/attitudes_yoy.svg\" alt=\"Attitudes around using Go at work\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/attitudes_community_yoy.svg\" alt=\"Community attitudes around welcomeness and confidence in direction of the Go project\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"prioritization\"\u003ePrioritization\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last few years we’ve asked respondents to rate specific areas on how satisfied they are and how important those areas are to them; we use this information to identify areas that are important to respondents, but with which they are unsatisfied. However, most of these areas have shown only minor differences in both importance and satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/imp_vs_sat2.svg\" alt=\"Scatter plot of importance compared to satisfaction showing most areas have high satisfaction and where binary size is less important than other areas\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year we introduced a new question to explore alternative ways to prioritize work on specific areas. “Let’s say you have 10 GopherCoins to spend on improving the following aspects of working with Go. How would you distribute your coins?” Two areas that stood out as receiving significantly more GopherCoins were dependency management (using modules) and diagnosing bugs, areas that we’ll be dedicating resources during 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/improvements_sums.svg\" alt=\"Overall sum of coins spent on each area for improvement\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"modules\"\u003eChallenges when working with modules\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most common module-related challenge was working across multiple modules (19% of respondents), followed by comments about versioning (including trepidation around committing to a stable v1 API). Related to versioning, 9% of responses discussed version management or updating dependencies. Rounding out the top 5 were challenges around private repos (including authentication with GitLab in particular) and remembering the different \u003ccode\u003ego mod\u003c/code\u003e commands plus understanding their error messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"learning\"\u003eLearning Go\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year we adopted a new construct to explore relative productivity among different levels of experience with Go. The vast majority of respondents (88%) agree that they regularly reach a high level of productivity and 85% agree they’re often able to achieve a flow state when writing in Go. The proportion of agreement increases as experience with Go increases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/productivity.svg\" alt=\"Charts showing proportion of respondents who agree they feel productive using Go and can achieve a state of flow while writing in Go\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"in-which-areas-should-we-invest-in-best-practice-docs\"\u003eIn which areas should we invest in best practice docs?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf of respondents wanted more guidance on best practices on performance optimization and project directory structure. Unsurprisingly, new Gophers (using Go for less than 1 year) need more guidance than more experienced Gophers, though the top areas were consistent across both groups. Notably, new Gophers asked for more guidance in concurrency than more experienced Gophers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/best_practices.svg\" alt=\"Chart showing which areas respondents want more guidance on best practices\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-do-developers-learn-a-new-language\"\u003eHow do developers learn a new language?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout half of respondents learned a new language at work, but almost as many (45%) learn outside of school or work. Respondents most often (90%) reported learning alone. Of those who said they learned at work, where there may be opportunities to learn as a group, 84% learned alone rather than as a group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/learn_where.svg\" alt=\"Chart showing half of respondents learned a new language at work while 45% learned a new language outside of school or work\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/learn_with.svg\" alt=\"Chart showing 90% of respondents learned their last new language alone\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the top resources highlight the importance of good documentation, but live instruction stands out as a particularly useful resource for language learning as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/learning_resources.svg\" alt=\"Chart showing which resources are most helpful for learning a new programming language where reading reference docs and written tutorials are most useful\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"devtools\"\u003eDeveloper tools and practices\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs in prior years, the vast majority of survey respondents reported working\nwith Go on Linux (63%) and macOS (55%) systems. The proportion of respondents who primarily develop on Linux appears to be slightly trending down over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/os_yoy.svg\" alt=\"Primary operating system from 2019 to 2021\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"targeted-platforms\"\u003eTargeted platforms\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver 90% of respondents target Linux! Even though more respondents develop on macOS than Windows, they more often deploy to Windows than macOS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/os_deploy.svg\" alt=\"Chart showing which platforms respondents deploy their Go code on \" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"fuzzing\"\u003eFuzzing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost respondents are unfamiliar with fuzzing or still consider themselves new to fuzzing. Based on this finding, we plan to 1) ensure Go’s fuzzing documentation explains fuzzing concepts in addition to the specifics of fuzzing in Go, and 2) design output and error messages to be actionable, so as to help developers who are new to fuzzing apply it successfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/fuzz.svg\" alt=\"Chart showing proportion of respondents who have used fuzzing\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"cloud\"\u003eCloud computing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo was designed with modern distributed computing in mind, and we want to continue to improve the developer experience of building cloud services with Go. The proportion of respondents deploying Go programs to three largest global cloud providers (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure) remained about the same this year and on-prem deployments to self-owned or company-owned servers continue to decrease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/cloud_yoy.svg\" alt=\"Bar chart of cloud providers used to deploy Go programs where AWS is the most common at 44%\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRespondents deploying to AWS saw increases in deploying to a managed Kubernetes platform, now at 35% of those who deploy to any of the three largest cloud providers. All of these cloud providers saw a drop in the proportion of users deploying Go programs to VMs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/cloud_services_yoy.svg\" alt=\"Bar charts of proportion of services being used with each provider\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"changes\"\u003eChanges this year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast year we introduced a \u003ca href=\"/blog/survey2020-results\"\u003emodular survey design\u003c/a\u003e so that we could ask more questions without lengthening the survey. We continued the modular design this year, although some questions were discontinued and others were added or modified. No respondents saw all the questions on the survey. Additionally, some questions may have much smaller sample sizes because they were asked selectively based on a previous question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most significant change to the survey this year was in how we recruited participants. In previous years, we announced the survey through the Go Blog, where it was picked up on various social channels like Twitter, Reddit, or Hacker News. This year, in addition to the traditional channels, we used the VS Code Go plugin to randomly select users  to be shown a prompt asking if they’d like to participate in the survey. This created a random sample that we used to compare the self-selected respondents from our traditional channels and helped identify potential effects of \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-selection_bias\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eself-selection bias\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/rsamp.svg\" alt=\"Proportion of respondents from each source\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost a third of our respondents were sourced this way so their responses had the potential to significantly impact the responses we saw this year. Some of the key differences we see between these two groups are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"more-new-gophers\"\u003eMore new Gophers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe randomly selected sample had a higher proportion of new Gophers (those using Go for less than a year). It could be that new Gophers are less plugged into the Go ecosystem or the social channels,  so they were more likely to see the survey advertised in their IDE than find it through other means. Regardless of the reason, it’s great to hear from a wider slice of the Go community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/goex_s.svg\" alt=\"Comparison of proportion of respondents with each level of experience for randomly sampled versus self-selected groups\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"more-vs-code-users\"\u003eMore VS Code users\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s unsurprising 91% of respondents who came to the survey from the VS Code plugin prefer to use VS Code when using Go. As a result, we saw much higher editor preferences for VS Code this year. When we exclude the random sample, the results are not statistically different from last year, so we know this is the result of the change in our sample and not overall preference. Similarly, VS Code users are also more likely to develop on Windows than other respondents so we see a slight increase in the preference for Windows this year. We also saw slight shifts in the usage of certain developer techniques that are common with VS Code editor usage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/editor_s.svg\" alt=\"Grouped bar chart of which editor respondents prefer from each sample group\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/os_s.svg\" alt=\"Grouped bar chart of primary operating system respondents use to develop go on\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"survey2021/devtech_s.svg\" alt=\"Grouped bar chart showing which techniques respondents use when writing in Go\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"different-resources\"\u003eDifferent resources\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe randomly selected sample was less likely to rate social channels like the Go Blog as among their top resources for answering Go-related questions, so they may have been less likely to see the survey advertised on those channels.\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cimg src=\"survey2021/resources_s.svg\" alt=\"Grouped bar chart showing the top resources respondents use when writing in Go\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you for joining us in reviewing the results of our 2021 developer survey!
