It seems like only yesterday that we\nwere preparing the initial public release: our\n\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20091112094121/http://golang.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e was\na lovely shade of yellow, we were calling Go a “systems language”, and you had\nto terminate statements with a semicolon and write Makefiles to build your\ncode. We had no idea how Go would be received. Would people share our vision\nand goals? Would people find Go useful?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt launch, there was a flurry of attention. Google had produced a new\nprogramming language, and everyone was eager to check it out. Some programmers\nwere turned off by Go’s conservative feature set—at first glance they saw\n“nothing to see here”—but a smaller group saw the beginnings of an ecosystem\ntailored to their needs as working software engineers. These few would form the\nkernel of the Go community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"5years/gophers5th.jpg\" width=\"850\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/blog/gopher\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGopher\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003eillustration by\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://reneefrench.blogspot.com.au/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRenee French\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the initial release, it took us a while to properly communicate the\ngoals and design ethos behind Go. Rob Pike did so eloquently in his 2012 essay\n\u003ca href=\"/talks/2012/splash.article\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGo at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and\nmore personally in his blog post\n\u003ca href=\"https://commandcenter.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLess is exponentially more\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\nAndrew Gerrand’s\n\u003ca href=\"http://vimeo.com/53221560\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCode that grows with grace\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n(\u003ca href=\"/talks/2012/chat.slide\"\u003eslides\u003c/a\u003e) and\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKGmK_Z1Zl0\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGo for Gophers\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n(\u003ca href=\"/talks/2014/go4gophers.slide\"\u003eslides\u003c/a\u003e) give a\nmore in-depth, technical take on Go’s design philosophy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver time, the few became many. The turning point for the project was the\nrelease of Go 1 in March 2012, which provided a stable language and standard\nlibrary that developers could trust. By 2014, the project had hundreds of core\ncontributors, the ecosystem had countless \u003ca href=\"https://godoc.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elibraries and tools\u003c/a\u003e\nmaintained by thousands of developers, and the greater community had\nmany passionate members (or, as we call them, “gophers”). Today, by our current\nmetrics, the Go community is growing faster than we believed possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere can those gophers be found? They are at the many Go events that are\npopping up around the world. This year we saw several dedicated Go conferences:\nthe inaugural \u003ca href=\"/blog/gophercon\"\u003eGopherCon\u003c/a\u003e and\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.dotgo.eu/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edotGo\u003c/a\u003e conferences in Denver and Paris, the\n\u003ca href=\"/blog/fosdem14\"\u003eGo DevRoom at FOSDEM\u003c/a\u003e and two more\ninstances of the biannual \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/GoCon/GoCon\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoCon\u003c/a\u003e conference\nin Tokyo. At each event, gophers from around the globe eagerly presented their\nGo projects. For the Go team, it is very satisfying to meet so many programmers\nthat share our vision and excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"5years/conferences.jpg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMore than 1,200 gophers attended GopherCon in Denver and dotGo in Paris.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also dozens of community-run\n\u003ca href=\"/wiki/GoUserGroups\"\u003eGo User Groups\u003c/a\u003e spread across cities\nworldwide.

Go arrived as the industry underwent a\ntectonic shift toward cloud computing, and we were thrilled to see it quickly\nbecome an important part of that movement. Its simplicity, efficiency, built-in\nconcurrency primitives, and modern standard library make it a great fit for\ncloud software development (after all, that’s what it was designed for).\nSignificant open source cloud projects like\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.docker.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDocker\u003c/a\u003e and\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKubernetes\u003c/a\u003e have been\nwritten in Go, and infrastructure companies like Google, CloudFlare, Canonical,\nDigital Ocean, GitHub, Heroku, and Microsoft are now using Go to do some heavy\nlifting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what does the future hold? We think that 2015 will be Go’s biggest year yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo 1.4—in addition to its \u003ca href=\"/doc/go1.4\"\u003enew features and fixes\u003c/a\u003e—lays\nthe groundwork for a new low-latency garbage collector and support for running\nGo on mobile devices. It is due to be released on December 1st 2014.\nWe expect the new GC to be available in Go 1.5, due June 1st 2015, which will\nmake Go appealing for a broader range of applications.\nWe can’t wait to see where people take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there will be more great events, with \u003ca href=\"http://gothamgo.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGothamGo\u003c/a\u003e in\nNew York (15 Nov), another Go DevRoom at FOSDEM in Brussels (Jan 31 and Feb 1;\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/1xgBazQzs1I/hwrZ5ni8cTEJ\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eget involved!\u003c/a\u003e),\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.gophercon.in/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGopherCon India\u003c/a\u003e in Bengaluru (19-21 Feb),\nthe original \u003ca href=\"http://gophercon.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGopherCon\u003c/a\u003e back at Denver in July, and\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.dotgo.eu/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edotGo\u003c/a\u003e on again at Paris in November.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Go team would like to extend its thanks to all the gophers out there.\nHere’s to the next five years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTo celebrate 5 years of Go, over the coming month the\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://blog.gopheracademy.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGopher Academy\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cem\u003ewill publish a series of articles by prominent Go users.
