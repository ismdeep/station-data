The Go team would like to thank everyone who has\ncontributed code, written an open source library, authored a blog post, helped\na new gopher, or just given Go a try. Without you, Go would not be as complete,\nuseful, or successful as it is today. Thank you, and celebrate!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003c/div\u003e",
