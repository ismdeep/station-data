As handles become names\nand avatars become faces, the smiles are real and true friendship can grow. There is joy\nin the sharing of knowledge and celebrating the accomplishments of our friends, colleagues,\nand neighbors. In our rapidly growing Go community this critical role is played by the\nGo user groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo better support our Go user groups worldwide, the Go community leaders at \u003ca href=\"https://gobridge.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoBridge\u003c/a\u003e\nand Google have joined forces to create a new program called the Go Developer Network\n(GDN).
