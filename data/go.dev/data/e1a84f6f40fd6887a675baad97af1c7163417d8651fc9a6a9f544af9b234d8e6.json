The results of this survey have helped the team plan and prioritize\nlarge changes to the Go ecosystem, such as dependency management, the gopls\nlanguage server, and most recently, generics. We want Go to be increasingly\nusable by and useful to developers, and your feedback has been a critical aspect\nof making this happen. Thoughtfully responding to these surveys takes time and\nenergy, and we deeply appreciate your efforts to help improve Go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday we’re launching a change in how we conduct our annual survey. Rather than\none large survey each November, we plan to launch two smaller surveys at roughly\nsix-month intervals during the year. Our hope is that shorter surveys will take\nless time and effort to respond to, with the added benefit of providing feedback\nto the Go team shortly after each new Go release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout further ado, \u003ca href=\"https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7O3x4IZKiUn0QCO?s=b\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere is the June 2022 edition of the Go Developer\nSurvey\u003c/a\u003e! This\nsurvey will run through June 21st, and we plan to publish anonymous, aggregated\nresults in late July. It should take less than 10 minutes to complete, and all\nquestions are optional.
