An actual invitation made it real and I\ndecided to accept and give a presentation about gofmt’s impact on software\ndevelopment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"gopherchina/image04.jpg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHello, Shanghai!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conference took place over an April weekend in Shanghai, in the\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Puruan+Bldg,+Pudong,+Shanghai,+China\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePuruan Building\u003c/a\u003e\nof the Shanghai Pudong Software Park, easily reachable by subway within an hour\nor less from Shanghai’s more central parts.\nModelled after \u003ca href=\"http://www.gophercon.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGopherCon\u003c/a\u003e, the conference was\nsingle-track, with all talks presented in a conference room that fit about 400\nattendees.\nIt was organized by volunteers, lead by \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/astaxie\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAsta Xie\u003c/a\u003e,\nand with robust sponsorship from major industry names. According to the\norganizers, many more people were hoping to attend than could be accommodated\ndue to space constraints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"gopherchina/image01.jpg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe welcoming committee with Asta Xie (2nd from left), the primary organizer.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach attendee received a bag filled with the obligatory GopherChina t-shirt,\nvarious sponsor-related informational brochures, stickers, and the occasional\nstuffed “something” (no fluffy Gophers, though). At least one 3rd party vendor\nwas advertising technical books, including several original (not translated\nfrom English) Go books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"gopherchina/image05.jpg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGo books!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn first impression, the average attendee seemed pretty young, which made for\nan enthusiastic crowd, and the event appeared well run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the exception of my talk, all presentations were given in Mandarin and\nthus were incomprehensible to me. Asta Xie, the primary organizer, assisted\nwith a few simultaneous translations whispered into my ear, and the occasional\nEnglish slide provided additional clues: “69GB” stands out even without any\nMandarin knowledge (more on that below). Consequently, I ended up listening to\na handful of presentations only, and instead spent much of my time talking with\nattendees outside the main conference room. Yet judging from the slides, the\nquality of most presentations seemed high, comparable with our experience at\nGopherCon in Denver last year. Each talk got a one hour time slot which allowed\nfor plenty of technical detail, and many (dozens) of questions from an\nenthusiastic audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs expected, many of the presentations were about web services, backends for\nmobile applications, and so on. Some of the systems appear to be huge by any\nmeasure.\nFor instance, a talk by \u003ca href=\"http://gopherchina.org/user/zhouyang\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYang Zhou\u003c/a\u003e\ndescribed a large-scale internal messaging system, used by\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.360.cn/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eQihoo 360\u003c/a\u003e, a major Chinese software firm, all written\nin Go. The presentation discussed how his team managed to reduce an original\nheap size of 69GB (!) and the resulting long GC pauses of 3-6s to more\nmanageable numbers, and how they run millions of goroutines per machine, on a\nfleet of thousands of machines. A future guest blog post is planned describing\nthis system in more detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"gopherchina/image03.jpg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePacked conference room on Saturday.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn another presentation, \u003ca href=\"http://gopherchina.org/user/guofeng\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFeng Guo\u003c/a\u003e from\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.daocloud.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDaoCloud\u003c/a\u003e talked about how they use Go in their\ncompany for what they call the “continuous delivery” of applications. DaoCloud\ntakes care of automatically moving software hosted on GitHub (and Chinese\nequivalents) to the cloud. A software developer simply pushes a new version on\nGitHub and DaoCloud takes care of the rest: running tests,\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.docker.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDockerizing\u003c/a\u003e it, and shipping it using your\npreferred cloud service provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral speakers were from well-recognized major software firms (I showed the\nconference program to non-technical people and they easily recognized several\nof the firm’s names). Much more so than in the US, it seems Go is not just\nhugely popular with newcomers and startups, but has very much found its way\ninto larger organizations and is employed at a scale that we are only starting\nto see elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot being an expert in web services myself, in my presentation I veered off the\ngeneral conference theme a bit by talking about\n\u003ca href=\"/cmd/gofmt/\"\u003egofmt\u003c/a\u003e and how its widespread use has started\nto shape expectations not just for Go but other languages as well.\nI presented in English but had my slides translated to Mandarin beforehand. Due\nto the significant language barrier I wasn’t expecting too many questions on my\ntalk itself.\nInstead I decided the keep it short and leave plenty of time for general\nquestions on Go, which the audience appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"gopherchina/image06.jpg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNo social event in China is complete without fantastic food.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of days after the conference I visited the 4-year-old startup company\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.qiniu.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eQiniu\u003c/a\u003e (“Seven Bulls”), at the invitation of its\n\u003ca href=\"http://gopherchina.org/user/xushiwei\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCEO\u003c/a\u003e Wei Hsu, facilitated and\ntranslated with the help of Asta Xie. Qiniu is a cloud-based storage provider\nfor mobile applications; Wei Hsu presented at the conference and also happens\nto be the author of one of the first Chinese books on Go (the leftmost one in\nthe picture above).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"gopherchina/image02.jpg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"gopherchina/image00.jpg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eQiniu lobby, engineering.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQiniu is an extremely successful all-Go shop, with about 160 employees, serving\nover 150,000 companies and developers, storing over 50 Billion files, and\ngrowing by over 500 Million files per day. When asked about the reasons for\nGo’s success in China, Wei Hsu is quick to answer: PHP is extremely popular in\nChina, but relatively slow and not well-suited for large systems. Like in the\nUS, universities teach C++ and Java as primary languages, but for many\napplications C++ is too complex a tool and Java too bulky. In his opinion, Go\nnow plays the role that traditionally belonged to PHP, but Go runs much faster,\nis type safe, and scales more easily. He loves the fact that Go is simple and\napplications are easy to deploy. He thought the language to be “perfect” for\nthem and his primary request was for a recommended or even standardized package\nto easily access database systems. He did mention that they had GC problems in\nthe past but were able to work around them. Hopefully our upcoming 1.5 release\nwill address this. For Qiniu, Go appeared just at the right time and the right\n(open source) place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Asta Xie, Qiniu is just one of many Go shops in the PRC. Large\ncompanies such as Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, and Weibo, are now all using Go in\none form or another. He pointed out that while Shanghai and neighboring cities\nlike \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Suzhou,+Jiangsu,+China\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSuzhou\u003c/a\u003e are\nhigh-tech centres, even more software developers are found in the Beijing area.\nFor 2016,  Asta hopes to organize a larger (1000, perhaps 1500 people)\nsuccessor conference in Beijing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt appears that we have found the Go users in China: They are everywhere!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSome of the GopherChina materials, including videos, are now available alongside Go coursework on a\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.imooc.com/view/407\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e3rd party site\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003c/div\u003e",
