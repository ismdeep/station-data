Sandy said that there were a bunch\nof WWII gun batteries worth seeing near the entrance to the harbor\nwhere Lyttleton lies, south of Christchurch. That sounded pretty good\nto us. Within 20 minutes the bike rental guy was there, providing us\nwith mountain bikes, helmets, locks, and a suggested route and we were\noff, pedaling furiously first through Christchurch traffic, then up a\nfairly wicked mountain grade, past residential zones at first and then\njust trees, rocks, wet clouds and, when the clouds parted, amazing\nviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"./static/jacobsen_pole07_set1/index.html\"\u003eThe first photo set for this trip\u003c/a\u003e will tell the story better than any\nwriting I can come up with - suffice it to say I was pretty astonished\nthat such rugged beauty lay within a vigorous pedal of\nChristchurch. And, that we were all thoroughly wasted after more than\neight hours of biking up and down the mountains south of CHC\n(sometimes on paths as challenging as a BMX bike course). At one\npoint, as we juddered down an especially challenging path, I jokingly\nasked Kael if this wasn\u0026#39;t one of those team-building exercises to get\nus ready for the Pole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOf course, no blog about New Zealand would be complete without a\npicture of a sheep:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://johnj.com/texted_IMG_2761.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"resize\" src=\"/texted_IMG_2761_hu3e011a3d15759de4f4c4cee6c943eb99_187501_700x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" style=\"width:500px; border:0px solid black;\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\nA Sheep\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe gun emplacements were also amazing. For reference, they are at\nGodley Head south and east of Christchurch. We had to get the bikes\nback by 1830h so we could only see half of what was there. I\u0026#39;ve seen\nWWII defensive emplacements in southern France, on Corsica, and in\nCalifornia, and these were much better preserved and much more\nextensive than any I\u0026#39;d ever seen. The coolest part was a set of\nunderground rooms and tunnels, completely dark (Kael\u0026#39;s flashlight and\nmy camera focus-flash kept us oriented).
