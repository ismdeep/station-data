Went out for a jog, just around the block, smelling forgotten,\nfriendly smells, but somehow got stuck in a run down neighborhood and\nhad to jump two fences just to get back to my hotel, which was within\nline-of-sight the whole time. As everyone knows, this place is not set\nup for pedestrians. All the trees here third-world-nation different\nand people drive gleamingly new cars but live in shabby\napartmentsâ€¦ I love California but even after living here for five\nyears it feels more like a tourist destination than Home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nI\u0026#39;m on the same flight to Auckland tonight so I still have 8.5 hours\nto kill.

I\u0026#39;m\nnot officially too jet lagged yet but am tired from being\nairport-bound until 3 AM this morning. Gibson\u0026#39;s protagonist describes\njet lag as your soul being reeled in from whatever far away place you\ncame from, drifting like a kite through the troposphere, slower than\nthe trans-oceanic jet you came in on. I\u0026#39;m trying to reel in my soul\njust as quick as can be, \u0026#39;cause soon he\u0026#39;ll have a long distance to\nmake up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWhen you\u0026#39;re tired but in your normal routine, you\u0026#39;ve still got the\nglue of that routine keeping you together and productive. When you\u0026#39;re\nin a new place, with time to kill, but alert and rested, you can\nhappily go exploring, or, if you\u0026#39;re a mobile tech warrior,\nproductively tick items off your lists of things to do. But one of the\nparadoxes of killing time while on travel is that you\u0026#39;re both uprooted\nand exhausted, so you live moment to moment, in a kind of blurry fog,\nnot sure what to do next, and too tired to care very much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nTime to repack, head to LAX and take another stab at Aotearoa, the\nLand of the Long White Cloud (New Zealand).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\nLater: \u003ca href=\"http://johnj.com/posts/auckland/\"\u003eAuckland; Leaving Already?\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\nEarlier: \u003ca href=\"http://johnj.com/posts/launched/\"\u003eLaunched\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/main\u003e",
