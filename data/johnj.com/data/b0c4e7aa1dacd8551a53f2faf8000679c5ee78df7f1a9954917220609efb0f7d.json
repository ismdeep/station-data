I wonder if Bono \u0026amp; co. could have\nimagined during their concert in 1988 that their music would fuel the\nworkouts of a few South Polies twenty years later. That’s the way it\nworks, I guess… most of the time we swim in a sea of ignorance about\nthe effects we have on each other and the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nTime for a 20 second shower before today’s first meetings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAnd who are you that reads this?
