Every year there is a\nChristmas Day race here called the Race Around the World. The winner\ngets to go to McMurdo and run in a marathon there (and usually wins,\nsince they are trained at high altitude). But flights yesterday got\ncancelled because all the Hercules C-130s had to go out to field\ncamps. Since “our” runner couldn’t get to McMurdo, South Pole is\nhaving its own marathon right now… outside. Starting gun was an hour\nago and they are still out running. I ran the first mile or so (lungs\nstill hurt!) and then cut across the course to photograph the leaders\nand, well, everyone else — there were only ten or so of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nIt was so fun! Probably not the safest or sanest thing I’ve ever done,\nbut I’m very glad I did it. It was made even more exciting by the fact\nthat we raced the clock to get the first 84-string IceCube run going\njust before the marathon. I literally had to run to my room to get\ndressed and then out to the Geographic Pole marker to make it in time\nfor the start. The Station doctor gave a short exhortation to stay\nsafe before we started… hopefully the people still out there are being\ncareful! The station turned out to provide water stops, sleeping bags,\ntoilets, aid stations, cheering and photography.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThere is a lot more I want to write about but I need to use the rest\nof the satellite pass for other things, so hello to everyone and good\nluck to the runners!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://johnj.com/5358210337_e1ed8d33e7_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"resize\" src=\"/5358210337_e1ed8d33e7_o_hu2efc712845e6ce2b3f4a0b9ad627a945_926946_700x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" style=\"width:500px; border:0px solid black;\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\nYours truly after 1/26th of the maraton\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\nLater: \u003ca href=\"http://johnj.com/posts/a-place-that-wants-you-dead/\"\u003eA Place That Wants You Dead\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\nEarlier: \u003ca href=\"http://johnj.com/posts/deep-fried-macaroni-and-cheese-balls/\"\u003eDeep Fried Macaroni and Cheese Balls\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/main\u003e",
