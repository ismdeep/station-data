I may as well give up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis story is a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen despair tells you “it hasn’t worked,” it means that we have\nfalsely assumed that the world owes us a particular outcome for our\nlabors. It doesn’t. The world promises one thing: the world\nitself. Included in that world is our freedom of action and some\ninherent capabilities. We are free to act, and we are free to choose\nhow to act. The world doesn’t promise us any particular outcome for\nour actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It hasn’t worked” means we expected some specific outcome and didn’t\nget it. We’re disappointed because we didn’t get the value we expected\nfrom the effort we expended, but that’s because we’re deriving value\nfrom the wrong thing. The world does not promise us value in exchange\nfor effort. We can have it if we want, but the world doesn’t supply\nit. We have to do that ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can’t reliably get it from outcomes, because outcomes aren’t up to\nus. Outcomes are like seasons and weather: they’re given to us by the\nwhims of fortune (or, if you prefer, Providence). We don’t choose\nthem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat we can choose is where we get our value. If we want to get value\nfor effort, we have to derive it from something that is up to us—for\nexample, from the effort itself. We must choose to make efforts that\nwe value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as “it hasn’t worked” is a false story about where value comes\nfrom, “I’ve tried as hard as I can” is a false story about our freedom\nof action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve tried as hard as I can” sounds right when we’re frustrated. It’s\na lie, though. Despair tells us that there’s nothing more we can do,\nbut despair doesn’t know that. It’s just pretending to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe may have tried everything we can think of, but that just means\nwe’ve exhausted our knowledge and imagination for the moment. It\ndoesn’t mean we’ve exhausted our options. We always have options we\ndon’t yet know about. Tomorrow we’ll know things we don’t know today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur efforts may have failed up to now, but tomorrow the world will be\ndifferent. We don’t know what will change, but we can be sure that\nsomething will. Nothing is more certain in life than change. Despair\nwhispers that nothing significant will be different, but it doesn’t\nknow that, either. It’s blowing smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespair is a liar. If you have a fanciful turn of mind you can think\nof it as a demon. It comes to us when we’re exhausted and frustrated\nand offers a false promise of comfort. It says to us, “There, there,\nit’s all right. There’s nothing you can do, anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don’t have to listen. We don’t have to believe its lies. We can\nrecognize that we’re exhausted and need to rest. We can give up for\nthe moment without giving up for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespair wants us to promise that we won’t try again, but we don’t owe\nit that. We don’t owe it anything. We can rest and wait for our\nstrength to return. We can wait for change, for new understanding, for\nhelp that we didn’t expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re free to choose a different goal, perhaps a better one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re free to choose what to value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e",
