This time the story is less about old damaged ships on the edge of the solar system, and more about crime and punishment in the big (orbital) city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me seven years to write my first unpublished book about this far-future world. These three stories have come much more quickly.I’m not sure what the difference is. Perhaps it’s that I’ve approached these stories with a lighter heart. I want to have fun with them, and I want the reader to have fun. It makes them fun to write. There’s still the constant struggle over dumb mistakes I make in the plot or awkwardness caused by my personal quirks and habits, but I’m doing something or other differently now that makes the story come out quicker and easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it’s just that I get along well with the characters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can still find books one and two on amazon:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Kestrel-Chronicles-2-Book/dp/B0161X4O6K/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-text\u0026amp;ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1448733049\u0026amp;sr=1-3\" title=\"The Kestrel Chronicles\"\u003eThe Kestrel Chronicles\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e",
