I did it for what appears to be a better opportunity, but we’ll find out. It’s not like you can ever fully know that the grass is greener on the other side in just a few hours of interviews, especially when you are the interviewee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving a company after 2 years does raise questions about me, especially when the work anniversaries of most of my colleagues are double digits. However, the circumstances calm my — and the interviewers’ — worries down. It seems to me the older people get, the more time they spend at one company. Or at least the less flexible they are to change. Perhaps I haven’t met enough people or encountered enough environments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile going through the lengthy employment termination process, I \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/measures-to-reform-post-termination-non-compete-clauses-in-contracts-of-employment\"\u003eheard\u003c/a\u003e that the Department for Business and Trade suggested that non-compete periods be limited to 3 months. I took a particular interest in this document, subscribed to the updates, and successfully referenced it in an argument against the period my ex-company wanted to enforce. The timing couldn’t be more favourable. It has shown me that contracts and the law are indeed necessarily vague.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI am grateful for my time at my first job. I learned a lot about software engineering, my industry, and people. Now, I am excited about new beginnings!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003c/div\u003e",
