Sometimes these are good, productive ideas, like the discovery of a new cure, others debatable (religions, barbaric customs, violence) but nevertheless \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr/\u003eThe beauty of the things that belong to all of us, like works of art and ideas, is that they have always been free… you are free to partake in a religion, you are free to choose not to, and so on. My “Ideas” are my code, your code, they are the code of millions of programmers all over the world who, like me, have decided to share them with whoever wants them, preserving what little good our generation will leave behind as a legacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, one other thing I’d like to add in introducing myself… \u003cstrong\u003ethe child in me has never accepted that pretty toys cost so much\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"dSploit-the-story-of-an-experiment\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#dSploit-the-story-of-an-experiment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"dSploit, the story of an experiment.\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003edSploit, the story of an experiment.\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cp\u003eYears ago, having purchased my first android terminal, good little nerd that I am, I began gathering information on programming, operating systems, and so on.\u003cbr/\u003eI had after all been using Linux for ever, how hard could it be to learn?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I signed up at \u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.xda-developers.com/\"\u003eXDA\u003c/a\u003e, read their guides (\u003cstrong\u003ethanks, guys!!! \u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e) and began experimenting… I needed an initial idea, so I decided to combine my background on network security with my first experiment, namely my first Android app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea was to somehow replicate \u003cstrong\u003eettercap\u003c/strong\u003e‘s features, in other words, to carry out a MITM attack on a WiFi network from a mobile phone, using an Android application. So I started researching on Google to see if someone had already pulled off something similar (\u003cstrong\u003eheaven forbid that I’d waste my time on an unoriginal idea! XD\u003c/strong\u003e) and not only did I find out that someone else had had the same idea, they were distributing it as a “semi-free” product with purchasable features… \u003cstrong\u003eunacceptable!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eNot only had my idea been “stolen” ( LOL! ) but it had been ruined and transformed into something hideous… I couldn’t take it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat started out as a project soon became my little “ethical revenge” :D\u003cbr/\u003eIt took me all of three days to learn how to program on Android, and set up my first prototype of what would soon be known as \u003cstrong\u003edSploit\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/2015/10/dsploit.jpg\" alt=\"dsploit\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeedles to say that the interface was as ugly as sin, slower than molasses, and as bugged as an old mattress… but it worked, and moreover, it was \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr/\u003eI immediately released the code on Github, and posted a link with a brief introduction on XDA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea that those tiny steps would turn my life around, in just a few years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe project literally exploded, the next day my inbox was clogged with replies to my XDA thread. People asking for more information, wanting to know how to compile the code, but most of all, people comparing it with that other app, the semi-free thing that had “ruined” my idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started working on it like a dog. During the day, I kept up with my job as a PHP programmer for a company in Rome, at night and during my summer break, I wrote miles of code, considered new concepts, new functions, things those “other people” hadn’t even thought of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy idea was for everyone, and my idea worked… my idea was free.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while I began exchanging emails with a couple of people that had developed the “other” app, sometimes we’d exchange tips, at other times we just chatted. Turns out, they were far from the “evils suits” I’d thought them to be; they were smart, friendly guys, but most of all they were open to new ideas.\u003cbr/\u003eI became especially friendly with one of them, and we carried on talking every now and again over the following two or three years. During this period I changed jobs, and moved to a new home, however my life hardly changed, I was still your average guy, with an average salary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, over a very short period of time, two months give or take, everything changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tornado hit on what seemed to be a very typical morning at the office. My friend from that other company wrote to me, saying something on these lines (I’ll never forget it):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eHey How are things? When are you planning on leaving that crappy job and joining us?\nYou\u0026#39;re our kind of stuff, you\u0026#39;ve always been.\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs chaotic as it was, everything began to make sense. Those seemingly insignificant, disconnected events had, maybe, been leading me to where I was destined to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout going into the details of the transition, the only relevant thing that happened during my first “job interview” which was in Amsterdam, mind you, was that my girlfriend, with whom I was about to celebrate our sixth anniversary, decided it was time she moved on, due to issues we’d already accepted and discussed, yada, yada, yada.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/2015/10/amsterdam.jpg\" alt=\"haxpo\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s fast-forward to today; it’s now more than a year that I’ve been working on my own, from home, and yet, I have a very high salary, the work is thrilling, and working hours very flexible… lately, I’ve met loads of people, some I know are just passing through, others I’m sure are here to stay… I’ve been able to indulge in things I couldn’t even dream about before, I travelled the world, and have seen more places in this last year than I’ve seen in a lifetime. I’ve been able to help many people I hold dear who needed some solid help, but most of all, I’ve realized something about money…. it doesn’t make you happy, but it gives you the necessary freedom to build that happiness, and freedom has been the only real thing I’ve sought after all my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll these things (and for those who have been paying attention, it was really quite clear where I was going with this) I couldn’t have achieved without that money, that came from an idea I had decided to set \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e… now that project has been forked, downloaded, cloned, improved upon, and belongs to the community, as it should.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to share this story to tell you a little about myself, debunk a few “myths” about the creation of dSploit, but most of all to give hope to all those who, like me, stay up all night in the name of an idea… be free, guys, let your ideas be preserved, and let them lead you where you are destined to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",
